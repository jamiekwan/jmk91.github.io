The biggest potential of 3D printing is its capacity for design democratization. We empower consumers to become active participants in the creation of their products by bridging the gap between 3D modelling and 3D printing, as well as the gap between 3D designers and consumers. Our mobile app uses parametric design (data-driven design) to make anyone a 3D designer, allowing for designs to be printed to personal specifications â€“ whether biometrics (perfect wearables) or just a personal keepsake!
