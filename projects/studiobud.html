<p>Co-founded as part of the <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/digitalmedia"> Master of Digital Media </a>program at Ryerson, we run rapid design sprint workshops about anything and everything, but with one commonality: we want to unlock the creative potential of GenZ youth in driving innovation through the power of play and design thinking.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/projects/studiobud/7.png" alt="Studio Bud" class="img-responsive"/></p>

<p>We lead collaborative workshops with our partners, putting youth in direct creative contact with non-profit and for-profit organizations. Unconstrained by the technical worries, youth collaborate to find inspiration, discover solutions, iterate quickly, and implement prototypes. They gain valuable skills through experiential learning, while partners gain insight and find inspiration through blue-sky ideation. After, continued collaborations are opened up to provide youth with real opportunities.</p>

<p>Past partners have included Canon Canada, Community Innovation Lab / NEET Youth Incubator, Harbord Collegiate Institute, the Supa Maasai Foundation, and Heroes in Black. More info can be found at <a href="http://www.studiobud.ca" target="_blank">www.studiobud.ca</a></p>
