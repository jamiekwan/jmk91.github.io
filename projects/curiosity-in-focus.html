---

<!-- <p>Rapidly facing population decline, the bee hotels strengthen the urban ecology by providing nesting spaces for solitary bees. For the <a href="http://wildforbees.ca/" target="_blank">Wild for Bees campaign</a>, the structures are built entirely from recycled urban material, while creating a site-specific aesthetic for an educational initiative centered on pollinator health. We wanted to show that bee habitats can be beautiful and easy to build in your own backyard!</p>

<p>As part of the SUSTAINABLE.TO team, I managed the design, build, and installation of the five bee hotels. Most structures were built in collaboration with youth from at-risk neighbourhoods, and travelled to local farmer's markets and neighbourhood events (100in1Day) as part of the educational campaign. In some cases, the construction was integrated into a community workshop to invite the public into the campaign.</p>

<p> S.TO was named the 2014 Pollinator Advocate for Canada, and a subsequent project, DIY Backyard Bee Hotels, was one of two winners of the David Suzuki Foundation's Homegrown National Park Design Challenge.</p> -->
