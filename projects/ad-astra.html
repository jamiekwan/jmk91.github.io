                        <p>Ad Astra was an interactive experience that immersed visitors into an infinite night sky and created a quiet — but memorable — retreat from a festival known for crowds and late-night antics across the City of Toronto. One of the core goals of the project was to create a simple, photogenic intervention that the general public could relate to, and become an active participant in the experience.</p>
                        <p>The room – approximately 20x20 feet in size – was filled with over 150 spherical lights, and clad from floor-to-ceiling in mirrored acrylic panels to create an infinite night sky. Visitors were invited to enter into the space — eight at a time – to explore. Open-ended interactions encouraged exploration, and upon discovery of "trigger" lights, the overall space responded with location-specific music and lighting changes in sync to the audio. Beyond the visual experience, Ad Astra turned small visitor interactions into large spatial responses.</p>

                        <p>This installation was a collaboration between 7 architecture grads, a biomedical engineer, a musician, and a sound engineer, and completed as part of ReduxLab at Ryerson University. The installation was exhibited as part of Scotiabank’s Nuit Blanche 2013, Toronto’s largest all-night public art festival, and named amongst the 'Must-See Independent Exhibits' by Designlines Magazine.</p>
